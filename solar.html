        The cyber kill chain is a model for understanding the stages of a cyber attack. It was first introduced by Lockheed Martin in 2011 and has since been widely
adopted as a framework for understanding how cyber attacks progress and how they can be stopped. The stages of the cyber kill chain are:

Reconnaissance: The attacker gathers information about the target, such as identifying potential vulnerabilities.
Weaponization: The attacker creates a means of delivering the attack, such as creating a malicious email or exploit.
Delivery: The attack is delivered to the target, such as sending a phishing email or injecting malware into a website.
Exploitation: The attack takes advantage of a vulnerability in the target system.
Installation: The attacker installs malware or other tools on the target system to give them persistent access.
Command and control: The attacker establishes a connection with the target system and can issue commands or exfiltrate data.
Actions on objectives: The attacker carries out their objectives, such as stealing data or disrupting operations.
By understanding the cyber kill chain, organizations can better defend against attacks by identifying and disrupting the attack at an early stage.
            Reflecting back on the SolarWinds attack in 2020, it all started with backdoor access to their network,
            and this resulted in a nightmare and being one of the worst cyberattacks. Growing up in a third-world
            country with poor internet infrastructure, ping scanning was a frequent tool I used when the internet
            goes down, and it used to feel like having a magic wand when using this basic tool in my community. But
            I learned so much more in this class. I understood the depth of different scanning tools and their
            purposes, which would add so much value to the things I do and my career as an IT support staff for my
            company.

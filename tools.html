            <h2>Lecture One: Scanning Tools</h2>
            <p>
                Perform a basic scan using standard tools such as traceroute, dig, and nslookup.
            </p>
            <p>
                Scanning tools help us understand our network information by giving us data on the incoming and outgoing
                communication through the bits and its ports. Since a computer network layer performs various activities
                through the transmission of data from one host to another, located in different networks, packets get
                sent as Information Form (Data Unit) which the router as a device takes the next action. In the popular
                network field, it’s said, "The network is known as the backbone of the telecommunication system which is
                used to share data and resources using data links."
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond finding information about our network through scanning tools, it’s also a great tool for
                vulnerability testing, which helps users find information on weak communication links that, if not
                monitored well and secured, could lead to network attacks.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this lab activity, I will share some of the tools we used during our lab activities, the outcome of
                the activities, the things we learned, and a few tips to help you better understand the good and bad
                side of scanning tools.
            </p>
            <p>
                During this lab activity, the first tool we used was ping, which shows the internet status seen in the
                images below. Then we tried ipconfig through the command line prompt and discovered the computer's
                detailed IP configuration, further exploring various scanning tools.

            <h3>Reflection:</h3>
            <p>
                Scanning tools, being tools to discover network communication information, can also mean network
                vulnerability. Also, one should not freak out when they see so many ports opened in their network or the
                sites they’re accessing. The work involved in this OSI layer model is too complex for a human to
                comprehend and manually attempt to manage so many ports, as thousands or millions of packets operate in
                the TCP/IP based on the network size.
            </p>
            <h3>QUESTION?</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>How many hops from your machine to your assigned website?</li>
                <p>Traceroute to emu.edu.tr: 9 hops</p>
                <li>Which step causes the biggest delay in the route? What is the average duration of that delay?</li>
                <p>To gold-surf.com, 172ms</p>
                <li>What are the main nameservers of that network?</li>
                <p>ns1.emu.edu.tr</p>
                <li>Who is the registered contact?</li>
                <p>administrator.emu.edu.tr</p>
                <li>What is the MX record for the website?</li>
                <p>Non-authoritative answer: emu.edu.tr MX preference = 0, mail exchanger =
                    emu-edu-tr.mail.protection.outlook.com</p>
                <li>Where is the website hosted?</li>
                <p>Not sure</p>
